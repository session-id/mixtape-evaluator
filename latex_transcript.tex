%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}

\DeclareMathOperator*{\argmin}{arg\,min}
\DeclareMathOperator*{\argmax}{arg\,max}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:

% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/

% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/

%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/

% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.

%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/

% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.

%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/

% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/

%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.

% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.

% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
Today's music industry is influenced by many factors that simply did not exist twenty years ago---current artists are capable of reaching out to potential fans using forms of online media. They are no longer limited in promoting their music by physical word of mouth or the advertising muscle of a record label. Instead, both artist who are just starting out and who had multiple album hits are using social media to build a presence, brand, and promote their current and upcoming music releases. However, the mediums used to consume music have changed as well. Music can be consumed instantly via online purchase or by streaming. More of our interactions with music itself are online rather than on music store shelves or the radio. This makes artists more independent of having to physically push albums.\\

Given metrics on social media platforms, we'd like to predict the success of an artist's upcoming release. Essentially, helping artists who can produce quality music benefits the entire industry, both on the consuming and producing side. Identifying more of these high potential artist early on can allow labels to give more artists the opportunities and resources to succeed sooner. With more resources, an artist gains more recognition and acclaim, more fans are generated, and the label maximizes their profit.

We'll be measuring success of an upcoming album release by looking both at an artist's track sales along with an artist's iTunes album sales one week after an album release. In order to make our predictions of album success, we'll be looking at social media metrics two weeks prior to an upcoming release. These social media metrics include Facebook likes, Twitter followers, LastFM plays, Myspace friends, Soundcloud plays, Pandora plays and a few others that are part of our dataset provided by Next Big Sound. Social media metrics like these are generated by real people being engaged with the music content. Thus, it should follow that with these metrics as features, we can use machine learning methods to predict an album's success. In this paper, we'll use linear regression, naive bayes, and support vector regression to see how well we can predict an album's success in terms of both total iTunes tracks downloads and album downloads one week after an album release.\\

\section{Related Work}
Previous work on using the Internet to predict album success has yielded some initially unintuitive and contradictory results. An early study of finding the relationship between user generated Internet content and albums sales looked at blog posts and album reviews to see if they correlated with album sales. The results were positive. Essentially, the more legitimate blogs and album reviews about a certain album, the more buzz it had in the Internet community, and so the more physical album sales were sold due to the popularity. In addition, it was found that only $\frac{1}{6}$ of "high chatter" albums were debut albums, which suggests that the biggest factor in a successful release is having had at least one prior successful release. This study used several linear regression varying in which independent variables were used such as number of blog reviews, sales rankings, and MySpace friends. p-values were analyzed to make its analysis. The results suggest that high Internet content generally happens when an artist has already had a quality release. This study focused on blog posts and album reviews, however. Thus, it was looking more closely at content generated by dedicated Internet users who were engaging with the content. [1]\\

However, a similar study conducted a few years later had opposite results. They found that buzz generated by blogs tended to have no correlation with increasing album sales. More interestingly, it was seen that having a large amount of hype on the Internet for a small artist results in a negative impact in track sales. Rather than high buzz allowing for an artist's music to be more well known and thus have more people buying it, it turns out that the higher amount of recognition results in lower sales at the track level. This isn't the case for an already mainstream artist, however. This study attributes this finding to blogs talking about small artists that tend to post ways to engage with individual tracks of an artist via mp3 download links or links to free streaming. Thus, listeners themselves promote artists in ways that make the music available for free. The study used panel vector autoregression (PVAR) to look at the bidirectional relationship between the dependent and independent variables. This allowed a way to see if they might be affecting each other and allowed for a more comprehensive analysis of how Internet media affects album and track sales. This study was limited in that it's measure of buzz was limited to blog sites and not social network sites like Facebook and Myspace.  [2]

Another study took a different approach by only directly using one social music site's data: Last.fm. This study created features at the artist and track level by processing thousands of listeners' Lastfm charts. Features such as total amount of listens on a tracks and total amount of listeners was generated via scrapping Lastfm. Using the generated features, the researchers attempted to predict the Billboards rankings of the tracks. They used Support Vector Machines, Na ̈ıve Bayes, Bayesian Networks and Decision Trees and got the best accuracy result of 81.31\% in predicting track placement in Billboards. [3] This study shows that looking at a social network's metrics can give some indicating of a track sales. However, this principal isn't necessarily generalizable to all social media platforms such as Facebook. Last.fm shows an interesting example since Last.fm simply counts the plays people listen to tracks on their devices or on its radio feature. Thus, it models the consumption while a site like Facebook shows relevance through likes. It then makes sense that a high amount of Last.Fm consumption of a track correlates with track purchases.\\

From 2012, part of the year our dataset will be from, we see that there have been almost 94 billion plays and 17 billion profile views across different social sites as calculated by Next Big Sound [4]. This tells us that there's is clearly an enormous amount of engagement with artists and their product online. Next Big Sound analyzed the metrics that they collect on artists and concluded which social media metrics contribute the most to an album's sales. Using a  Granger causality test, which looks at whether one timeseries of data is able to forecast another, Next Big Sound found that Facebook likes, Wikipedia views, Vevo plays, YouTube plays, and SoundCloud plays were most significant in forcasting album sales [5]. This suggest that it should be possible to use machine learning methods on such features to predict album sales at least.


\section{Dataset and Features}
The dataset that we used to test build our models was Next Big Sound's Challenge dataset, a set containing social media metrics along with YouTube play counts and iTunes sales data for anonymized artists over the course of roughly two years. There was data available for 1818 artists over a total of 909457 artist-days in the years 2011 and 2012.

For each artist, a variety of different social media metrics were available for Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Last.fm, MySpace, and SoundCloud in addition to several other music sites. Notably, the date of album releases by artists was also provided, allowing us to narrow our focus to the prediction of short term album success (measured by the number of sales made by an artist in the week following an album release) based on social media metrics.

Much of the data, however, was filled with NaN's, indicating that artists did not have profiles in the various social media services. The median percentage of days for which a metric was unavailable was a high 79.7\%, with only 17 of the 100 fields containing non-NaN data for over 50\% of all artist days.

Because values for most of the metrics spanned several orders of magnitude (very popular artists, for example, could have hundreds of times more tracks sold than average artists), we decided to use the log of most metrics in place of their actual values in our analysis.

We initially settled upon using the number of iTunes tracks sold in the week following an album release as our y variable for regression, as it was the most widely available metric related to artist success (available for 80\% of the data). However, we quickly discovered that, for many artists, album releases did little to change their sales counts from what they were prior to these album releases. As a result, we decided to also look at predicting the change in track sales following an album release (measured as $\Delta_{track} = log(sales\_after/sales\_before)$) as a possible measure of \textit{album} and not \textit{artist} success. \textbf{delta\_tracks\_distribution2.fig}

This resulted in a total of ~1600 album releases that could be used as examples for both training and testing. 100 random samples of the evolution of track sales per day for an artist around an album release are shown in the figure below. Here, day 7 (the day corresponding to peaks in several of the sales paths) represents the day that an album was released. \textbf{sales\_paths.fig}

To deal with the presence of NaN's inside the data, we used different methods that varied based on the learning algorithms we used. For some of our models, we also imposed the additional restriction that artist data for the 7 days prior to an album release also be available so that we could use more advanced time-based predictors besides the metrics on the day of a release.

One of the most relevant time-based features was the "acceleration" $a_t$ of an artist's track sales one week prior to release, computed as:

$$a_t = \frac{s_{t-1} - s_{t-7}}{s_{t-1} + s_{t-7} + 1}$$

where $s_t$ is the total number of iTunes track sales on artist-day t. This acceleration metric gives a rough sense of how quickly track sales are either increasing or decreasing, scaled so that its value always lies between -1 and 1.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Linear Regression}
The first form of regression we tried on the data was a simple ordinary least squares linear regression. We were looking to predict a real valued metric based on a vector of features at every album release, so using least squares was a reasonable first approach. Because there is no easy way to deal with NaN's in a linear regression, we decided to restrict our data to those artist-days where the Facebook likes and Twitter followers for the day were all not NaN (very few, if any points, had no NaN's for a larger subset of relevant social media metrics).

We then constructed a predictor matrix $X$ with the first two columns consisting of the total number of Facebook page likes and the total number of Twitter followers for artists on the artist-days selected by the criteria above. A column of ones was added at the end of the X vector to include an intercept term in the linear regression. $y$ simply consisted of the values of $\Delta_{track}$ at the corresponding days.

The least squares regression model seeks to fit a parameter $\theta$ such that predictions of a responding variable $y$ given an observed vector $x$ are given by
$$h_\theta(x) = \theta^T x$$
Formally, we minimize the sum of squared differences between the values of $h_\theta(x^{(i)})$ and $y^{(i)}\}$ given observations $\{(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}); i = 1,\dots,m\}$. This is done by minimizing the cost function
$$J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2$$
In our formulation, this problem simplifies to minimizing $J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} (X\theta - y)^2$ with respect to theta, yielding the optimal value $\hat{\theta}$ given by
$$\hat{\theta} = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y$$

After trying out purely using Facebook and Twitter metrics, we also introduced metrics computed using the iTunes tracks sales in the week prior to an album release as features in the $X$ matrix. In particular, the acceleration of iTunes sales prior to an album release was the most relevant such predictor, as will be shown later.

\subsection{Naive Bayes}
The Naive Bayes classifier provides a more explicit method of dealing with NaN's, but in order for the classifier to be used, both the predictors and responding variable have to first be discretized into separate classes.

Values for each metric were turned into discrete features by measuring how many half standard deviations they were away from the mean non-NaN value for the metric (all values greater than two standard deviations from the mean were placed on boundary categories on both sides), and NaN values were assigned to a separate category. This allowed us to change each predictor $x^{(i)}$ and responder $y^{(i)}$ into a vector of multinomial variables (each of which has 11 possible values). \textbf{May change later!}

The buckets themselves were assigned in this manner: $(-Inf, -2\sigma)\rightarrow1, (-2\sigma, -1.5\sigma)\rightarrow2, \dots (1.5\sigma,2\sigma)\rightarrow9, (2\sigma,Inf)\rightarrow10, NaN\rightarrow11$. Because the responding variable ($\Delta_{tracks}$) was never NaN, the difference between the predicted bucket for $\Delta_{tracks}^{(i)}$ and the actual bucket of $\Delta_{tracks}^{(i)}$ can be used to provide a rough estimate of the standard error of the Naive Bayes classifier in the context of regression. All that needs to be done to get this rough estimate of the absolute error in predicting $\Delta_{tracks}$ is to multiply the average error measured in number of buckets by half the standard deviation of $\Delta_{tracks}$.

The Naive Bayes classifier is based on the strong assumption that all individual features $x_i$ (in our case the values of the multinomial variables corresponding to each field) in observation $x$ are conditionally independent given the corresponding class $y$. This allows us to simplify the conditional probability $p(x|y)$ of observation $x$ occuring given class $y$ into
$$p(x|y) = p(x_1,\dots,x_n | y) = \prod_{i=1}^n p(x_i|y)$$
where all values of $p(x_i|y)$ can be much more efficiently computed and stored than values of $p(x_1,\dots x_n|y)$. Using Bayes' Rule, we can now easily use these conditional probabilities $p(x|y)$ along with class probabilities $p(y=k)$ to make predictions:
$$p(y=k|x) = \frac{p(x|y=k)p(y=k)}{p(x)}$$
The best class fitting an observation $x$ would then be given by $\argmax_k p(y=k|x)$.

Maximum likelihood estimates for the multinomial variables in the Naive Bayes classifier are easily fit by simply tallying up the occurrences of $\{x^{(i)}_j = l \wedge y^{(i)} = k\}, i=1,\dots,m, j=1,\dots,n$ for $l,k=1,\dots,n_{categories}$, where $n$ is the number of features for each $x^{(i)}$ and $n_{categories}$ is the number of discrete categories for both the predictors and responder (in our case 11). To assign reasonable nonzero probabilities to the occurrence of all events, we use Laplace smoothing, a technique equivalent to initializing the classifier with one occurrence of each $\{x^{(i)}_j = l \wedge y^{(i)} = k\}$ event.

It is true that the features in our data certainly violate the Naive Bayes assumption; Facebook likes and Twitter followers, for example, actually show very strong correlation despite having not much correlation with $\Delta_{tracks}$. Practically speaking, however, Naive Bayes typically still works well even in situations where there may be correlation between input variables.

\subsection{Support Vector Regression}
$\epsilon$-support vector regresssion allows us to find a function that tries to maintain within the boundary specified by $\epsilon$, and minimize the cost of errors outside $\epsilon$. This model also maps the features to a higher-dimensional space and uses a Kernel to easily compute the inner product of our feature mapping.

$\epsilon$-support vector regresssion can be posed as the following optimization problem
$$min\quad \frac{1}{2}\|w\|^2 + C\sum_{i=1}^m\xi_i+\xi_i^*$$
$$s.t.\quad \left \{ \begin{tabular}{ccc}
  &y_i - \langle w,x_i \rangle - b \leq \epsilon + \xi_i\\
  &\langle w, x_i \rangle + b - y_i \leq \epsilon + \xi_i^* \\
  &\xi_i,\xi_i^* \geq 0
  \end{tabular}
$$

We then construct a Lagrange function to produce the dual optimization problem:
$$max \quad \left \{ \begin{tabular}{ccc}
  &-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j=1}^{m}(\alpha_i - \alpha_i^*)\langle x_i, x_j\rangle\\
  &\langle w, x_i \rangle + b - y_i \leq \epsilon + \xi_i^* \\
  &\xi_i,\xi_i^* \geq 0
  \end{tabular}
$$

To account for the possible non-linear relation of the data, we used the radial basis function (RBF) kernel
$$K(x_i,x_j) = exp(-\gamma{\|x_i - x_j\|}^2), \gamma > 0$$

\section{Results}
To evaluate the performance of each of our models, we evaluated their standard error in the prediction of $\Delta_{tracks}$ on a test set after being trained on a separate training set. To get an absolute sense of how effective each of the methods were, we can measure the percentage of variance in $\Delta_{tracks}$ explained by a method.
\subsection{Linear Regression}
The linear regression approach we initially used was incapable of dealing with NaN's, so we had to narrow down our initial set of album releases to only the 996 releases that contained both artist Facebook and Twitter data.

It's important to note that by throwing out those artists who do not have both Facebook and Twitter accounts, we inherently bias the values of $\Delta_{tracks}$ that we look at. This is apparent when we compare the CDF's of the distribution of $\Delta_{tracks}$ for artists that have both Facebook and Twitter and metrics and those that only have one or neither: \textbf{delta\_tracks\_social\_media\_cdfs.fig}

Artists that have both Facebook and Twitter accounts typically have better album success (as measured by $\Delta_{tracks}$), indicating that there is definite information that can be gleaned from the fact that artists are missing a social media profile. For now, we set aside this difference and continue to focus on those artists that have both Facebook and Twitter data to see how these two predictors factor into an artist's change in track sales.

Our results match up with the somewhat counterintuitive results of \textbf{Citation for that one paper} in that Facebook likes and Twitter followers were actually negatively correlated with album success as measured by $\Delta_{tracks}$. The covariance matrix for Facebook likes, Twitter followers, and $\Delta_{tracks}$ is shown in \textbf{Table 1}.

\begin{table}[!t]

\caption{Covariance Matrix for Facebook likes (FB), Twitter Followers (Tw), and $\Delta_{tracks}$}
\label{covariance_1}

\begin{tabular}{c|ccc}
 & FB & Tw & $\Delta_{tracks}$\\
\hline
FB & 0.9565 & 0.7090 & -0.0769\\
Tw & 0.7090 & 1.0508 & -0.0423\\
$\Delta_{tracks}$ & -0.0769 & -0.0423 & 0.1361
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The resulting linear predictor had a standard error of 0.3598, corresponding to a variance of 0.1294. The additional two features, then, explain 5\% of the variance of the restricted dataset (0.1361), adding a small amount additional predictive power. Because this value alone was so low, we decided that it was not worth it to further pursue cross validation tests with these features alone.

The use of a third feature, the acceleration of an artist's iTunes sales prior to an album release (computed as the percentage change in track sales per day over the week prior to a release), was what most improved the performance of the linear regression model. This feature had a high 0.456 correlation with $\Delta_{tracks}$ and alone was capable of explaining 21\% of the variance of the set of 1543 test examples for which this metric was available (0.1297), attaining a standard error of 0.3205. A plot of acceleration vs $\Delta_{tracks}$ along with the corresponding regression line is shown in Figure \_. \textbf{delta\_tracks\_vs\_track\_momentum\_regression.fig}

To verify that this performance would hold even using out of sample data, we utilized a variant of k-fold cross validation that averaged the out of sample prediction error of this linear predictor over 1000 trials, with each trial randomly selecting 70\% of the data for training and 30\% of the data for testing.

The classifier performed well on this form of cross-validation. We computed the average standard error of the linear classifier to be 0.3208, corresponding to a variance of 0.1029, a significant decrease from the 0.1297 variance of $\Delta_{tracks]$ in all examples for which $a_t$ was available.

Using both Facebook and Twitter metrics with artist iTunes acceleration did improve the average standard error of the classifier to 0.3203 under the same cross-validation scheme, corresponding to 25\% variance explained (the smaller datset also had a higher variance of 0.1370). However, because the use of Facebook and Twitter metrics restricts the albums that can be classified significantly (1543 to 984), we decided that it was not worth including these metrics despite the slight improvement they produced in total variance.

A summary of the results for linear regression is shown in \textbf{Table 2}.
